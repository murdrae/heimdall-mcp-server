# Contributing to Heimdall MCP Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Heimdall! This document outlines how to contribute to the project and explains our dual licensing model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (3.11+ recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cognitive-memory.git`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .[dev]`
5. Initialize the project: `heimdall project init`
6. Run tests: `pytest tests/`

## 📋 Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start
- Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
- All contributions must target the `dev` branch (not `main`)

### 2. Making Changes
- Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
- Make your changes following the code style guidelines
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest tests/`

### 3. Submitting Changes
- Push your changes to your fork
- Open a Pull Request targeting the `dev` branch
- Fill out the PR template completely
- **First-time contributors**: Add a comment stating "I have read and agree to the CLA"

### 4. Code Review
- All PRs require maintainer approval
- CI checks must pass (linting, type checking, tests)
- Address any feedback promptly

## 🎯 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting
- Pass `mypy` type checking

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Maintain test coverage for modified code
- Use descriptive test names

### Documentation
- Update docstrings for new/modified functions
- Update `CLAUDE.md` for architectural changes
- Update CLI help text for new commands
